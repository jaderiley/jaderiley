# Hey, I'm Jade 👋

🎓 Final-year Bachelor of Computing student at [Belgium Campus ITversity](https://www.belgiumcampus.ac.za/), passionate about building real-world software that solves real-world problems.

💻 I enjoy working on practical, hands-on projects that involve clean architecture, user-focused design, and systems that just *work*. I'm all about making businesses more efficient with the help of good code.

## 🧠 A Bit About Me

- 🔍 Love figuring things out — especially how systems, people, and numbers interact.
- 💡 Big fan of applied statistics and problem-solving in business environments.
- 🛠️ Focused on:
  - Full-stack development (JavaScript, React, Node.js, C#, .NET)
  - Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)
  - Clean code principles and object-oriented programming
  - Software design patterns and architecture
- ⚙️ Learning every day and building a portfolio to show it.

## 🔨 Projects

Here are a few of the real-world inspired projects I’m working on or planning:

- **Student Management System** – Full CRUD desktop app with proper business logic using C# and Windows Forms
- **Telecom Customer Types** – OOP system with Prepaid and Contract logic
- **Horse Race Dashboard** – JavaScript web app showing performance stats and leaderboards
- **QR Code Factory Tracker** – Tracking products and raw materials using QR codes and form automation

> I built these to solve real problems, not just follow tutorials.

## 🎯 Goals

- 🧠 Build a strong, clean portfolio with actual value behind it
- 💼 Get hired into a developer role where I can learn, contribute, and grow
- 📊 Eventually branch into data-heavy roles where stats and systems meet
